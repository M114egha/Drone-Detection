# Drone-Detection with YOLOV8

-This project focuses on detecting drones using YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model.
- The dataset includes various types of drones, enabling detection in restricted or private areas where drone activity is regulated.
- YOLOv8, a variant of YOLO (You Only Look Once), known for its real-time object detection capabilities is used for mode building
- Annotated dataset is used from Roboflow containing images of different drone types.
- Applications: Security enhancement in sensitive locations, monitoring airspace violations, and ensuring compliance with drone regulations.
